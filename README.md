👋 Hi, I’m Johan Stiven (a.k.a. @dev-gringo)

👀 I’m interested in software engineering, data science, and cybersecurity, backend with java. html5, css, javascript.

🌱 I’m currently learning backend development with Java, diving into cybersecurity fundamentals, and improving my Excel skills — all while studying Software and Data Engineering at the Institución Universitaria Digital de Antioquia.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on backend tools, open-source projects, and anything that helps me grow while solving real-world problems.

📫 How to reach me:

😄 Pronouns: He/Him (Él)

⚡ Fun fact: I run *La 74 GOURMET*, where I serve burgers and chicharrones with love — and between orders, I sneak in time to code. I'm also passionate about learning English and always eager to gain experiences that enrich both my personal and professional journey.
